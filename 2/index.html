        Helping Junior Data Scientists for Preparing Interviews and Job Searches
      </a>
    </h1>
    <span class="post-date">October 16, 2020,
      
         Posted by Heuna Kim
      
    </span>
    <p>From 2019 to 2020 for two semesters, I participated the course “data analytics for Python”, organized by <a href="https://www.redi-school.org/berlin">ReDI School Berlin</a> as a teacher. From the second semester, I started mentoring one of the students. I helped him especially to apply for data-science-related jobs. Also I had many more chances to actively help some other friends, who want to become data scientists as fresh graduates. In the first part of this blog, I would like to share my impression about the current job market based on their situations. The second part is the modification of the email that I have sent to my ReDI School mentee in October 2020. It contains the tips of the interview preparation for junior data scientists, who are starting their careers.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-recent-job-market-for-junior-data-scientists-compared-to-3-5-years-ago">Part 1: Recent Job Market for Junior Data Scientists Compared to 3-5 Years Ago</h2>
<p>These are three points of my impression compared to 3-5 years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li>More companies know better what they want from and can get out of data scientists.</li>
<li>Most positions require a narrower range of skills, that are more specialized according to their titles.</li>
<li>There are many more people who want to start data science careers and companies want mostly only experienced data scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p>A friend of mine who recently started as a junior data scientist told me a story: her uncle told her that she as a data scientist could just claim as a team lead or a senior data scientist and easily demand a higher salary. It is somewhat true that the titles for data-science-related jobs are generally inflated compared to other technical positions. Probably it is because 1) the field is new so there are not many experienced people and 2) many of those people spent relatively longer time for their education.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the supply of the data-science-related job market has drastically changed and her uncle’s statement is no longer true. 3-5 years ago people having experiences with quantitative experiments and coming from diverse backgrounds, for example, psychology or politics, could get data science positions relatively easier than now. For last months also probably with the combination of the current pandemic situation, many friends told me that over 100 applicants are shown in LinkedIn job advertisements for most of junior data scientist positions.</p>
<p>Also the requirements for most of these positions became more clear and specialized for last 3-5 years. For example, big data, data engineers, Machine Learning Scientists, data analysts, geospatial engineers, reinforcement learning experts, computer vision specialists, natural language specialists and data scientists for recommendation engine or for price forecasting and so on; they are now more clearly distinguished from each other. I see no longer <code>Hadoop</code>, <code>Tableau</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>tensorflow</code> and <code>SQL</code> in the same job description. It used to be the case 3-5 years ago.</p>
<p>Most of job descriptions nowadays clarify more specifically about and match better to the projects that companies are interested in. I can see that it got harder for people who are now starting out their data science careers. But also as looking at those job descriptions, I image that they can probably improve on their skills faster in more focused working environments.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-promised-interview-preparation-list">Part 2: Promised interview preparation list</h2>
<p>As mentioned, this is a modification of my private email with the same title. I need to say that this is not a complete list for an interview preparation. Nevertheless, I hope that this list is helpful for those who are starting out their careers.</p>
<h3 id="interview-question-lists-on-the-internet">1. Interview Question Lists on the Internet</h3>
<p>There are some lists of classical interview questions on the Internet. Be aware that most of the answers from those lists are not always precisely correct. Also some of them are outdated and fit better to the job market 3-5 years ago. I believe that it is probably not necessary to go through all these lists. Nevertheless, I think it is worthwhile to skim them quickly and check what topics are missing in your knowledge.</p>
<ul>
<li>These examples are also not chosen based on my preference: <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2016/02/21-data-science-interview-questions-answers.html">1</a> <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-30-data-science-interview-questions-7dd9a96d3f5c">2</a> <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-science-tutorial/data-science-interview-questions">3</a>.</li>
<li>You can find some more on GitHub as well: <a href="https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/data-science-interviews/blob/master/theory.md">1</a> <a href="https://github.com/kojino/120-Data-Science-Interview-Questions">2</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="useful-books">2. Useful Books</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition by Aurélien Géron</a> is often most recommended to read for data science and machine learning relevant interview preparations for quickly refreshing your knowledge. If this book is too difficult for you, my suggestion for an easier book would be <a href="https://www.statlearning.com/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R</a>. (You can download the free pdf on the Internet.) All the codes are in R in this book and these days R is used less and less in industry so I actually recommend this book only for the basic-level theoretical purpose. There is a coursera course by Andrew Ng based on this book. Probably this is the most well-known data science course.</p>
<h3 id="sqldatabase-software-engineering-design-pattern-object-oriented-programming-concepts-big-data-hadoop-kafka">3. SQL/Database, Software Engineering, Design Pattern, Object-oriented Programming Concepts, Big data (Hadoop, Kafka)</h3>
<p>Prepare these topics mainly looking at the job advertisements for the positions that you are interested in. I would regard them less as core skills for data-science-related jobs except for data engineers. Also these topics are very broad by their own.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some more tips:
<ul>
<li>If you want to check out your SQL skills, check out the SQL section in <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> with the easy mode.</li>
<li>Understanding and reviewing important git commands is also a good idea if you are preparing these topics.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find some of my notes in these topics at the end of this blog post.</p>
<h3 id="study-on-your-own-cv">4. Study on your own CV</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important part. All the words and projects written on your CV are good candidates for the interview questions. Prepare to answer them all confidently. In other words, I would recommend not to write keywords that you cannot explain well.</p>
<h3 id="keywords-for-you-should-know-topics">5. Keywords for You-Should-Know Topics</h3>
<p>Here I added a list of general important keywords; in my opinion, an applicant of a data scientist position is expected to know these concepts. Please try to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Differences between (Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning), Difference between generative and discriminative models, Difference between batch and online learning</li>
<li>Difference between overfitting/underfitting, Concept of Bias-Variance Dilemma, Splitting Training, Validation and Test set, Cross Validation</li>
<li>Examples of regression methods, metrics, difference between ridge, lasso, elastic net and why you want to use them</li>
<li>Examples of classification methods, metrics (precision, recall, type 1/2 error, confusion matrix, ROC, AUC), when to use Support Vector Machine and when to use Random Forest, kernel trick for SVM</li>
<li>Examples of different ensemble techniques: bagging, boosting, stacking, when to apply them and their effects</li>
<li>Examples of clustering methods</li>
<li>the chain law of calculating a derivative, the concept of Stochastic Gradient descent and back propagation, the mechanism of activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoids)/ convolution unit/ pooling, regulation methods for NN (dropout, batch normalization, skipping connection)</li>
<li>Difference between feed forward networks and recurrent networks and their examples</li>
<li>the concept of PCA and Autoencoder for the dimension reduction</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are advanced topics that it is good to know when to use them but it is relatively less expected for a junior data scientist to know:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sampling (MCMC, Gipps, Metropolis Hastings…), EM, Gaussian Process, GAN, CRF+HMM+Kalman filter, Autoregression and ARIMA (Time Series), Matrix Factorization, Collaborative Filtering, Graphical Models, Variational Inference, Topic modeling and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Reinforcement-Learning-related topics</p></li>
<li><p>Python</p>
<ul>
<li>generator/iterator, decorator, context manager, coroutine, property</li>
<li>Sometimes you are asked to implement very simple codes from the concepts above e.g. max pooling or cross validation, ReLU, stride for a convolutional neural network</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="notes-for-3.">6. Notes for 3.</h3>
<p>Theses notes are handwritten and probably too compact to learn these concepts. Hopefully you can still capture important keywords or use them for looking up or for refreshing what you have learned already.</p>
